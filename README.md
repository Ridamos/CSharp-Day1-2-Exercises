# My first C# exercises (Day 1-2)

This repository contains a collection of small console programs created while learning the basics of the C# programming language. Each project is in a separate folder and demonstrates certain concepts.

## Projects

Here is a brief description of each project:

* **InterpolationAndTernary:**
    * Purpose: Demonstrates the use of string interpolation (`$“{variable}”`) for easy output formatting and the ternary operator (`condition ? value1 : value2`) for shortened condition writing.
    * Key concepts: Console output, string interpolation, ternary operator.

* **NumberComparison:**
    * Purpose: The program asks the user for two numbers and compares them, displaying which number is greater or reporting that they are equal.
    * Key Concepts: Input from the console (`Console.ReadLine`), type conversion (`int.Parse`), conditional statements (`if-else if-else`), comparison operators (`==`, `>`).

* **Operators:**
    * Purpose: Demonstrates how basic arithmetic operators work in C#: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`). Special attention is paid to integer division and floating point division (using `double`).
    * Key concepts: Arithmetic operators, integer division, type conversion (`(double)`), output.

* **Output:**
    * Purpose: Simple examples of outputting text and variable values to the console using `Console.WriteLine()`.
    * Key concepts: `Console.WriteLine()`, basic C# syntax.

* **ParityCheck:**
    * Purpose: The program prompts the user for a number and checks whether it is even or odd using the remainder of division operator (`%`).
    * Key concepts: Data input, `int.Parse`, remainder operator (`%`), `if-else`.

* **ScoreToGrade:**
    * Purpose: The program receives the number of points (score) from the user and converts it to a letter grade (A, B, C) or reports a failure according to the specified criteria.
    * Key concepts: Data input, `int.Parse', logical operators (`&&' - “AND”), complex conditions in `if-else if-else'.

* **Testing:**
    * Assignment: Draft/sandbox project.
    * Key concepts: All of the above concepts were tested.
